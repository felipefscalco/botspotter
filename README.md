# Bot Spotter

### Implementation of a Web-Scrapper in ruby of an Alternate Tibia Server Website

The goal of this web scrapper is to verify the uptime of players online, by doing this I can identify who is using unofficial software (bot) to play and go hunt them down :)

The website is hosted in **Heroku**, every hour a task is ran to update the uptime of the online players .

You can check the website running [here](https://bot-spotter.herokuapp.com/)
